## Private Events

Created as part of The Odin Project's [Rails Project: Associations](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/associations?ref=lnav), this app allows users to organize private event networks through invitations.

Currently attendees must be added to events via the command line. Invitations will be added later.

    Users signin and create events and then view various events in order of previous, upcoming and present events. Users can send invitations to events and also attend events created by other users. Events take place at a specific date and at a location.
