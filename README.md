## Private Events

Created as part of The Odin Project's [Rails Project: Associations](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/associations?ref=lnav), this app allows users to organize private event networks through invitations.

Currently attendees must be added to events via the command line. Invitations will be added later.
